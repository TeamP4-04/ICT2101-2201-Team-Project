an embedded video that runs through all the system test cases you have created (and refined) from M2
~3 mins long to cover all system tests

## Whitebox Testing

- choose one meaningful class to demonstrate your test code. “Meaningful” here means 2 or more interactions with other classes, e.g., a Control class. Please do not use an Entity class.
- list the test cases for this test suite (for this one class) and where they reside in your repo
- show code coverage statistics for each test case, including an explanation of how you have generated these statistics (whether manual, through a lib, or via the IDE)
- provide instructions how to run the test suite
- embed an animated gif or another short video (~1 min) of the test case being ran
